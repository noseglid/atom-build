# Atom Build package
[![Build Travis](https://travis-ci.org/noseglid/atom-build.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/noseglid/atom-build)
[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/noseglid/atom-build.svg)](https://gitter.im/noseglid/atom-build)

Automatically build your project inside your new favorite editor, Atom.

  * `cmd-alt-b` / `ctrl-alt-b` builds your project.
  * `cmd-alt-g` / `ctrl-alt-g` cycles through causes of build error. See [Error Matching](#error-match).
  * `cmd-alt-h` / `ctrl-alt-h` goes to the first build error. See [Error Matching](#error-match).
  * `cmd-alt-v` / `ctrl-alt-v` Toggles the build panel.
  * `escape` terminates build / closes the build window.

Supported build tools:

  1. Custom by [specifying your own build command](#custom-build-command)
  1. [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) (runs `npm install`) - if `package.json` exists where `engines['node']` is set
  1. [Atom](http://atom.io) (runs `apm install`) - if `package.json` exists where `engines['atom']` is set
  1. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - if `Gruntfile.js` exists
  1. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - if `gulpfile.js` exists
  1. [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) - if `Makefile` exists
  1. [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) - if `mix.exs` exists
  1. [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io) - if `Cargo.toml` exists
    * Supports error matching.

If multiple viable build options are found, `atom-build` will
prioritise according to the list above. For instance, if `package.json` and
`Gruntfile.js` are both available in the root folder, `npm install` will be
executed by `atom-build`.

If you need to run `grunt`, `gulp` or other tool to build your project, then you can utilize the [postinstall-script](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html) of package.json. This will also help you if grunt is run as a node module since it
will be downloaded (via `npm install`) prior.

## Specifying a custom build command

If the built-in defaults are not enough to suit your needs, you can specify
exactly what to execute. Create a file named `.atom-build.json` in your project root:

    {
      "cmd": "<command to execute>",
      "args": [ "<argument1>", "<argument2>", ... ],
      "sh": true,
      "cwd": "<current working directory for `cmd`>",
      "env": {
        "VARIABLE1": "VALUE1",
        "VARIABLE2": "VALUE2",
        ...
      },
      "errorMatch": "^regexp$",
      "buildViewTimeout": 1000
    }

Note that if `sh` is false `cmd` must only be the executable - no arguments here. If the
executable is not in your path, either fully qualify it or specify the path
in you environment (e.g. by setting the `PATH` var appropriately on UNIX-like
systems).

<a name="custom-build-config"></a>
### Configuration options

  * `cmd` - **[required]** The executable command
  * `args` - **[optional]** An array of arguments for the command
  * `sh` - **[optional]** If `true`, the combined command and arguments will be passed to `/bin/sh`. Default `true`.
  * `cwd` - **[optional]** The working directory for the command. E.g. what `.` resolves to.
  * `env` - **[optional]** An array of environment variables and their values to set
  * `errorMatch` - **[optional]** A regular expression to match output to a file, row and col. See [Error matching](#error-match) for details.
  * `buildViewTimeout` - **[optional]** Interval in milliseconds to dismiss build view

### Replacements

The following parameters will be replaced in `cmd`, any entry in `args`, `cwd` and
values of `env`. They should all be enclosed in curly brackets `{}`

  * `{FILE_ACTIVE}` - Full path to the currently active file in Atom. E.g. `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build/lib/build.js`
  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_PATH}` - Full path to the folder where the currently active file is. E.g. `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build/lib`
  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_NAME}` - Full name and extension of active file. E.g., `build.js`
  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_NAME_BASE}` - Name of active file WITHOUT extension. E.g., `build`
  * `{PROJECT_PATH}` - Full path to the root of the project. This is normally the path Atom has as root. E.g `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build`
  * `{REPO_BRANCH_SHORT}` - Short name of the current active branch (if project is backed by git). E.g `master` or `v0.9.1`.

<a name="error-match"></a>
## Error matching

Error matching let's you specify a regular expression which captures
the output of your build command and opens the correct file, row and column of
the error. For instance:

```bash
a.c:4:26: error: expected ';' after expression
  printf("hello world\n")
                         ^
                         ;
1 error generated.
```

Would be matched with the regular expression: `^(?<file>[^\\.]+.c):(?<line>\\d+):(?<col>\\d+)`.
After the build has failed, pressing `cmd-alt-g` (OS X) or `ctrl-alt-g` (Linux/Windows), `a.c` would be
opened and the cursor would be placed at row 4, column 26.

Note the syntax for match groups. This is from the [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/) package
and has the syntax for named groups: `(?<name> RE )` where `name` would be the name of the group
matched by the regular expression `RE`.

The following named groups can be matched from the output:
  * `file` - **[required]** the file to open. `(?<file> RE)`.
  * `line` - **[optional]** the line the error resides on. `(?<line> RE)`.
  * `col` - **[optional]** the column the error resides on. `(?<col> RE)`.

Since the regular expression is written in a JSON file, backslashes must be escaped.

The `file` should be relative the `cwd` specified. If no `cwd` has been specified, then
the `file` should be relative the project root (e.g. the top most directory shown in the
Atom Editor).

If your build outputs multiple errors, all will be matched. Press `cmd-alt-g` (OS X) or `ctrl-alt-g` (Linux/Windows)
to cycle through the errors (in the order they appear, first on stderr then on stdout).

Often, the first error is the most interesting since other errors tend to be secondary faults caused by that first one.
To jump to the first error you can use `cmd-alt-h` (OS X) or `ctrl-alt-h` (Linux/Windows) at any point to go to the first error.
